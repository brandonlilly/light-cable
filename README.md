## LightCable
Quick exercise in ActionCable and three.js. Also uses Rails 5, React, and Redux.
Highly experimental, only tested in Chrome.

### Usage
Chat in bottom left corner. WASD/QE/RF, and arrow keys to navigate. Open in multiple
tabs and move to see yourselves flying around. Still need to implement disconnecting.

### Install

`bundle install`  
`rails s`
